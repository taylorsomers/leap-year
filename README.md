# Leap Year Indicator

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  This website calculates whether a given year inputted by the user is or is not a leap year. In addition to this explicit functionality, it demonstrates some of what I have learned about the usage of bracket notation in jQuery and JavaScript, if/else business logic, user interface logic for displaying and hiding text, and constructing functions in jQuery and Javascript.
